Present Perfect Tense:
The present perfect tense is used to indicate a link between the present and the past. The action happened at an unspecified time before now. The exact time is not important. It is often used to talk about experiences, changes, or accomplishments.

Examples:
- She has visited Paris several times.
- I have completed my assignment.
- They have moved to a new house.

Common words with present perfect: already, yet, ever, never, just, so far, recently.

Usage:
- Life experiences: "I have been to London."
- Changes over time: "He has grown a lot this year."
- Accomplishments: "Scientists have developed new technologies."
- Uncompleted actions with expected completion: "She has not finished her homework yet."

Present Perfect Continuous Tense:
The present perfect continuous tense emphasizes the duration of an action that started in the past and continues into the present or has recently stopped with visible effects.

Examples:
- She has been studying for three hours.
- It has been raining since morning.
- They have been working on this project for weeks.

Usage:
- Actions continuing to now: "I have been reading this book all day."
- Actions that just stopped but have present effects: "You are tired because you have been running."

Key time expressions: for, since, lately, recently.

Difference Between Present Perfect and Present Perfect Continuous:
The present perfect focuses more on the **result** of an action, while the present perfect continuous focuses more on the **process** or **duration**.

Examples:
- Present Perfect: "I have painted the room." (Focus: The room is now painted.)
- Present Perfect Continuous: "I have been painting the room for two hours." (Focus: The process and how long it took.)

Summary:
- Present Perfect = Result (What happened? What is completed?)
- Present Perfect Continuous = Process + Duration (How long has something been happening?)

Common Mistakes:
- Using time expressions like "for" and "since" wrongly.
- Forgetting that present perfect often does not mention when the action happened.
- Confusing the focus: result vs. duration.

Tips:
- Think about whether you are focusing on **what** happened or **how long** it has been happening.
- Use "have/has been + verb-ing" for present perfect continuous.
- Use "have/has + past participle" for present perfect.
